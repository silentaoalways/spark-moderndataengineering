## Chapter 9: Introduction to Stream Processing
This chapter is mostly about theory and presenting the world of stream processing across timeseries, real-time, near real-time. It breaks down the problems that arise with respect to thinking about problems as a time series problem, or a view of events as the progress over time. You will find yourself learning about common problems with time, literally between timezones and due to clock skew, and how NTP and UTC came into the picture to help fix these issues.

The examples located under `data/` are there to shed some additional background on the code examples used in the chapter, but there is nothing here that needs to be compiled as this is an exercise free chapter aimed at preparing you to work with Apache Spark's Structured Streaming in chapter 10.
