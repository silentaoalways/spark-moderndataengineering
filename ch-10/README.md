# Chapter 10:
## Design Patterns for Writing Structured Streaming Applications

These chapter exercises are presented to show you working examples of how to design Apache Spark Structured Streaming applications. The book will be your guide through the source code itself, but the environment to run these exercises is available to you locally through the various application containers and the environment composition `docker-compose.yaml` files introduced throughout the course material.

The `/exercises` directory is broken down into sections corresponding to the chapter exercise environments, while the `/applications` directory is broken down to the applications for each exercise.

### /exercises/01_redis-streams
This is the environment for running the redis streams exercise. The corresponding Spark application is located under `/applications/redis-streams`.
